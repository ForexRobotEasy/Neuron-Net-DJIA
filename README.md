# Neuron Net DJIA

This code is a sample implementation of a trading robot that uses a neural network model to make predictions for DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) trading. The code is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com).

## Description

The Neuron Net DJIA trading robot uses a trained neural network model to predict the movement of DJIA prices. It connects to the Python interpreter and loads the neural network model to make predictions based on the current price and the previous prediction.

The trading robot executes trading logic on each tick by retrieving the latest price from the market. If the price has changed, it prepares the input data for prediction, makes the prediction using the neural network model, generates trading signals based on the prediction, and executes the necessary trading actions.

The trading actions include placing buy or sell orders based on the prediction signals. The robot calculates the entry price, stop loss, and take profit levels for each order and uses the OrderSend function to execute the trades.

The robot also includes initialization and deinitialization functions to connect and disconnect from the Python interpreter, close any open positions, and unload the neural network model.
